## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The [Van Allen lab](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/) is a computational lab at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](https://www.dana-farber.org/), [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/), and the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) whose mission is to drive precision cancer medicine through **clinical computational oncology** by:
- Creating the engine to clinically interpret cancer genomes
- Discovering response and resistance mechanisms to cancer therapies
- Developing new ways to dissect cancer data
- Exploring the inherited and environmental impact on cancer origins
- Establishing the next generation of computational oncologists
